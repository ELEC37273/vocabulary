Biologists study complex animal behaviors to find out why these behaviors evolved, how they function, how they're transferred to the next generation and so forth. The courting behavior of the bowerbird is studied for all these reasons. A bowerbird’s about the size of a pigeon and found mostly in Australia's rainforest, which is a small but ecologically diverse area in northeastern Australia. Bower refers to the male bird’s nest or structure. Now, most birds, including female bowerbirds, build nests to raise chicks, but male bowerbirds build elaborate structures to help them attract mates. 

Take a look at this bowerbird decorating the outside of his structure. As you see, construction takes place on the forest floor, not in a tree, and apparently the female Bowerbirds like blue decorations. The male decorates the bower with feathers, flowers, pebbles, and shells. We’ve found bowers decorated with bright blue clothes pins probably snatched from someone's backyard. Bowerbirds are also known to steal ornaments from other bowerbirds. When the bower is ready, a female bird may come over to it and watch the male perform for her. He'll dance, sing, or rather chirp, often quite energetically. 

Okay. So there are 17 different kinds of bowerbirds all classified by the type of bower they build. And there are three major types of bower. First is the mat bower. Mat Bowers are the least elaborate and the easiest to build. They're basically thick pads made from sticks and leaves surrounded by ornaments. With mat bowers, there's no real shelter for the female. So when the males are doing their performance, they keep their bellies close to the ground, signaling they will not attempt to mate unless invited to do so. In this way, they don't frighten or overwhelm the female. Next is the maple bower. And maple bowers are built around a small tree, a sapling. But they sometimes have two towers of twigs with a little covered bridge between them. Maple bowers often have a moss lawn, which is kept neat and fresh. 

Now, the most **elaborate** bower is the avenue bower, like the one you saw on the slide. First, the bird constructs an avenue, which is like a tent out of twigs, and then it places ornaments all around it. The female can actually go into this bower to watch the male’s performance. And we believe that bowers generally, and especially avenue bowers, provide protection for the female, protection against unwanted mating perhaps, or so she won't feel threatened during the courting dance. Oh, oh, and the male may even paint the inside walls of his bower. He paints with saliva, saliva mixed with chewed up blueberries along with charcoal. 

So let's consider the factors that drive male bowerbirds to create these structures. One biologist Gerald Borgia has been studying bowerbirds for more than 20 years. Borgia found, well, first recall that many bird species select their mates based on the attractiveness of their feathers or plumage. The peacock’s a prime example. Well, one biologist hypothesized that the bowerbirds that build the most elaborate bowers had the least colorful plumage, but Borgia has disproved that hypothesis. He found no significant relationship between dull feathers and fancy bowers. 

Georgia has found differences in the bowers based on where they're located. The fanciest ones tend to be in valleys as opposed to hill tops. He thinks this has something to do with the available light. Hill tops are often cloud covered, so females can't see the bowers very well, in the valleys, though there's more sunshine. In another study, they found that 75% of females returned to the same mate year after year and visit no other bower. 

So you have to wonder why the males would go to such trouble every year, you know, uh, especially since there's no guarantee, especially for young males that any female will choose them. But who knows? Maybe one of you will shed some light on this one day. 

Borgia is also very interested in finding out whether bowerbird behaviors are learned from their elders, or whether these behaviors are encoded in their genes at birth. Well, like painting, do they learn to paint by watching another male bird? Or do they just know how to do it? To figure this out, Borgia is raising some male bowerbirds in captivity, some with older birds to learn from and some without.

生物学家研究复杂的动物行为，以了解这些行为是如何进化的、它们的功能是什么、如何传递到下一代等等。彩鸟的求偶行为就是为了这些原因而被研究的。彩鸟的体型差不多像鸽子，主要分布在澳大利亚的热带雨林中，这是一片位于澳大利亚东北部的小而生态多样的区域。Bower（巢穴）指的是雄性鸟的巢或结构。通常，鸟类，包括雌性彩鸟，建造巢穴来抚养小鸟，但雄性彩鸟则建造精致的结构来吸引配偶。

看看这只彩鸟装饰它的巢的外面。正如你所看到的，建造发生在森林的地面，而不是树上，显然雌性彩鸟喜欢蓝色的装饰。雄性用羽毛、花朵、鹅卵石和贝壳来装饰巢。有时我们会发现巢里装饰有明亮的蓝色衣夹，很可能是从别人家后院偷来的。彩鸟也以偷窃其他彩鸟的装饰物而闻名。当巢准备好后，雌鸟可能会飞过来观看雄鸟的表演。雄鸟会跳舞、唱歌，或者说是发出类似叫声的声音，通常相当有活力。

好吧。现在有17种不同种类的彩鸟，按它们建造的巢的类型来分类。巢有三种主要类型。第一种是垫巢（mat bower）。垫巢是最简单、最容易建造的，它们基本上是由树枝和叶子做成的厚垫子，四周装饰着物品。垫巢没有为雌鸟提供真正的庇护所。所以当雄鸟表演时，它们会把肚子贴近地面，表示除非得到邀请，否则不会尝试交配。通过这种方式，它们不会吓到或让雌鸟感到压倒。接下来是枫木巢（maple bower）。枫木巢是围绕一棵小树（树苗）建造的，但有时会有两座由树枝做成的小塔楼，并且它们之间有一个小的有顶桥。枫木巢通常有一个苔藓草坪，保持整洁和新鲜。

现在，最精致的巢是大道巢（avenue bower），就像你在幻灯片上看到的那样。首先，雄鸟用树枝建造一个像帐篷一样的大道，然后在周围放置装饰物。雌鸟实际上可以进入这个巢观看雄鸟的表演。我们认为巢，尤其是大道巢，提供了对雌鸟的保护，可能是为了防止不受欢迎的交配，或者是为了让她在求偶舞蹈时不会感到威胁。哦，哦，雄鸟甚至可能会在巢的内墙上画画。他们用唾液、与咀嚼的蓝莓混合的唾液和木炭来画。

那么，让我们考虑驱使雄性彩鸟建造这些结构的因素。一位生物学家杰拉尔德·博尔吉亚（Gerald Borgia）研究彩鸟已经超过20年。博尔吉亚发现，首先，回忆一下，许多鸟类通过羽毛或羽饰的吸引力来选择配偶，孔雀就是一个典型的例子。有一位生物学家假设，那些建造最精美巢穴的彩鸟羽毛最不鲜艳，但博尔吉亚推翻了这一假设。他发现羽毛的颜色与巢的华丽程度之间没有显著的关系。

博尔吉亚还发现巢的位置有差异。最华丽的巢往往位于山谷，而不是山顶。他认为这与光照有关。山顶经常被云雾遮盖，雌鸟看不清楚巢，而山谷里阳光充足。在另一项研究中，他们发现75%的雌鸟每年都回到同一只雄鸟那里，而不会去其他巢。

所以，你不得不想知道，为什么雄性每年都这么辛苦地去建造这些巢呢，尤其是对于年轻的雄鸟来说，根本没有保证任何雌鸟会选择它们。但谁知道呢，也许有一天你们中的某人会揭示这个谜题。

博尔吉亚也非常想知道，彩鸟的行为是从长辈那里学到的，还是这些行为在出生时就已经写入基因中了。比如说，像画画一样，它们是通过看其他雄鸟学会的，还是它们天生就会？为了弄清楚这一点，博尔吉亚正在人工饲养一些雄性彩鸟，其中一些和年长的鸟一起生活以供学习，而另一些则没有。
