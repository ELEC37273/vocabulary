Professor:  Okay, we've talked about renewable energy as an alternative way of generating electricity. Alternative to what? To non-renewable energy, such as coal or petroleum or natural gas, something that will eventually run out of, because we're consuming it at a faster rate than it's being regenerated. Okay, so what's our primary source of renewable energy? Ken?

Student: The sun? 

Professor: Yes. But it's not so easy to use it to generate electricity because…

Student: Uh, it doesn't work at night. 

Professor: Okay. 

Student: And it doesn't work very well in places where it's cloudy a lot of the time. 

Professor: That's right. And the sun's energy is not that easy to capture. We're trying to use giant panels called solar cells to capture the sun's rays and convert them into electricity. And we've had some success. But, well, let's just say that the idea of using the sun as the principal source of energy in the United States is, well, as someone once said, it's kind of like the sun itself, big and bright, but further away than it seems. 

Okay, now let's talk about the ocean as another source of renewable energy. The ocean has two kinds of mechanical energy that we can use, the tides, and the waves. In order to use tides to generate electricity, the difference between high and low tide has to be at least five meters or about 16 feet. There are only about 40 places on the planet with that kind of tidal range. And there's actually only one really big tidal energy power station in the world. That's in France. Yes, Susan. 

Student: So do they build a dam like they do it on some rivers?

Professor: Yes. They build a dam across a bay and they have gates and turbines in the dam. And when the tides produce the required difference in the water level on opposite sides of the dam, the gates are opened and water's forced through the turbines, which turn a generator which produces electricity. 

Okay, so what about the waves? There are two kinds of power systems we can use to convert the energy in waves into electricity. There's what we call an offshore system where you have devices that are installed in deep water that float on the waves in the open sea. And then you have what we call an onshore system where you install your devices along the shoreline to extract the energy from waves that are breaking on the shore. And there are several varieties of these systems. 

Student: I've never heard of that. 

Professor: No, most people haven't, because wave power is a lot like tidal power. You only have a handful of places in the world where it's practical to use waves to produce electricity. So there's a fundamental problem with trying to harness the ocean's mechanical energy. Yes, Ken. 

Student: What about using the heat energy in the ocean? Has anybody tried to do that? I mean, I know the ocean has to absorb a lot of heat from the sun. 

Professor: Well, yes, they have, as a matter of fact, we have a process called ocean thermal energy conversion or O-tech to convert that heat into electricity. The ocean covers more than70% of earth's surface. And it's like a huge solar panel, a huge solar cell collecting solar energy and heating up. The sun warms the surface water a lot more than the deep ocean water. And that temperature difference creates thermal energy. Ocean thermal energy conversion works best when the temperature difference between the surface water and the deeper water is about 20℃. You have those conditions in a lot of tropical areas. 

Actually, the idea of tapping the thermal energy of oceans goes way back. The first O-tech system was built around, I think it was 1930. Unfortunately, O-tech systems are very expensive. Still, there are some energy experts who believe that they might be a major power source in the future if we can figure out how to make them more efficient. 

And O-tech might have a significant side benefit. There are a number of valuable minerals dissolved in ocean water. But when they studied the possibility of mining, you know, extracting minerals from the ocean, they've always said it wasn't feasible because it would cost too much money, one to pump all that ocean water and two to extract the elements. But if you have O-tech plants already pumping the water, you don't have to worry about that cost. You just have to figure out how to reduce the cost of extraction.

### Lecture Translation (General Meaning)

教授：好了，我们讨论过了可再生能源作为发电的替代方式。那么，它替代的是什么呢？替代的是非可再生能源，比如煤炭、石油或天然气，这些能源终究会耗尽，因为我们消费它们的速度快于它们的再生速度。那么，我们主要的可再生能源来源是什么？Ken？

学生：太阳？

教授：对。不过用太阳能发电并不那么简单，因为……

学生：呃，太阳晚上不能用。

教授：对。

学生：而且在很多时候经常有云的地方，太阳能也发挥不了太大作用。

教授：没错。太阳能并不容易捕获。我们正在尝试使用巨大的面板，称为太阳能电池，来捕捉太阳的光线并将其转化为电力。我们取得了一些成功。但是，嗯，姑且说，作为美国主要能源来源的太阳能，就像有些人曾经说过的那样，既大又亮，但距离我们想象的要远得多。

好吧，现在我们来谈谈海洋作为另一种可再生能源。海洋有两种我们可以利用的机械能：潮汐和海浪。为了利用潮汐发电，高潮和低潮之间的水位差必须至少为5米，约16英尺。地球上只有大约40个地方具有这种潮汐范围。实际上，世界上只有一个真正大型的潮汐能发电站。它在法国。是的，Susan。

学生：那么他们是不是像在一些河流上那样建造大坝？

教授：对。他们在一个海湾上建造大坝，并且大坝里有闸门和涡轮机。当潮汐产生大坝两侧水位差时，闸门会被打开，水流通过涡轮机，驱动发电机发电。

那么，海浪呢？我们有两种可以用来将海浪中的能量转化为电力的发电系统。第一种是我们所谓的近海系统，设备被安装在深水中，随着海浪在海面上浮动。然后是我们所谓的岸上系统，设备安装在海岸线上，用来提取海浪撞击海岸的能量。这些系统有几种不同的形式。

学生：我从来没听说过这个。

教授：是的，大多数人都没听说过，因为海浪发电和潮汐发电很像。全世界只有少数地方适合利用海浪发电。所以，利用海洋机械能有一个根本的问题。是的，Ken。

学生：那么利用海洋的热能呢？有人尝试过吗？我知道海洋必须从太阳吸收大量热量。

教授：嗯，确实有。事实上，我们有一种叫做海洋热能转换（O-tech）的过程，可以将热量转化为电力。海洋覆盖了地球表面超过70%的面积，像一个巨大的太阳能面板，收集太阳能并加热。太阳将表层海水加热得比深海水更为明显，这种温差就形成了热能。海洋热能转换在表面水与深层水之间的温差约为20℃时效果最佳。热带地区就有这种条件。

其实，利用海洋的热能这一想法可以追溯到很久以前。第一个O-tech系统大约建于1930年。不幸的是，O-tech系统非常昂贵。尽管如此，还是有一些能源专家认为，如果我们能找到方法提高其效率，它们可能会在未来成为一个重要的能源来源。

而且，O-tech可能还有一个显著的副作用。海水中溶解了许多有价值的矿物质。但在研究是否能从海洋中开采矿物时，一直认为这是不可行的，因为这样做太昂贵：一是需要把海水抽上来，二是提取矿物质的成本太高。但如果你已经有O-tech工厂在抽水，那么这些费用就不需要担心了。你只需要找出如何降低提取成本。
