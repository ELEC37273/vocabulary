Professor: So, uh, we've established that ancient Mesoamerican culture shared unique art, architecture and technology for thousands of years. Uh, what we're gonna talk about today is the art of another one of the early Mesoamerican cultures, the Olmec civilization. 

Now, to analyze any work of art, it helps to know about the people who created it. The problem here is that we don't know a lot about the people who created the Olmec civilization. And much of what we know about them, we actually only know through their art. 

Why do we know so little? Well, the Olmec civilization began around 1,200 B.C. and lasted for just 700 years. By 400 B.C. Olmec society was gone. 

Uh, we know that the people lived in small agricultural communities in uh, the swampy, low lands of southern Mexico. They fished, raised turkeys, had an extensive trade network of valuable materials like jade. They had a writing system as well. We'll see their writing on various pieces of their art as we study it. But it's their art, not their writing, that they're known for. 

The Olmec created large stone sculptures, uh, painted murals, fine pottery, and and little figures carved out of jade. But their gigantic stone heads are the most famous of their art.Here's a picture of one. These heads are huge, approximately three meters high. That's at least a whole meter taller than most of us, right? And they're almost just as wide. 

Uh, they all have similar features. Uh, the heads are really round, and they've all get broad noses. And these very full downturn lips. It looks like they're frowning. They're so characteristic. It's easy when you see one of the heads to look at it and say, yep, that's Olmec. 

And something really surprising, astonishing really, the heads were carved out of a very hard type of rock using only stone tools. The Olmec didn't have metal tools. And and yet with just these stone tools, they created what many considered the best quality sculptures in ancient Mesoamerica. It's really striking how they achieved such remarkable sophistication with such basic tools.

Student: What's that hat on its head? It looks like some kind of helmet or something. Did they wear armor? You know, for fighting wars? 

Professor: Well, it is a helmet and helmets like these probably did provide protection in battles, but uh, most archaeologists and art historians think it was also used in a ball game, a ceremonial ball game of the Olmec culture. Teams played the game with a rubber ball on courts that were built specially for those games, which which brings up an interesting point. 

Let's say you've come across an ancient sculpture in the jungle, and carved onto its head is a helmet. But you don't know anything about the culture it came from. So you'd probably assume it was for protection during war. But if you knew that other ancient people groups in the area played a ballgame, and you knew they wore lots of protective clothing during the game, then you'd realize there might be another meaning. It might not be a warrior, it might be the head of a ball player. 

So you see, as an art historian, you must also study, be knowledgeable about subjects like anthropology and and archaeology, so that you can see how different cultures have influenced one another.  You have to understand a culture, its region, its neighbors, to really understand how its artistic style developed, what its symbols mean, to come up with a valid interpretation of the art. In others words, you can't study just art because you have to have something to relate the symbols in art to. Now, um, let's see what's next. Oh yes, uh, the jaguar.

The jaguar is a common image in Olmec art. This large, predatory cat was prevalent throughout the Americas. Uh, it was very important to Olmec culture and religion. So it's not surprising that we see it so often in their art. It was frequently used to represent, actually to glorify someone important, like a ruler. You even see it represented in the stone heads, uh, like that stone head we just looked at. You saw the mouth, the the way the lips turned down, it looked a lot like the mouth of a big cat, a jaguar, didn't it? 

And this is one of the reasons why many researchers believe that these heads represent important rulers of the period. Uh, Jenny.

Student: I'm sorry, professor, but now I'm confused. Are these heads? Are they ball players or rulers? 

Professor: Or Warriors? Rulers often fill many roles, some real some ceremonial. So these sculptures could symbolize more than one thing. But regardless, uh, the similarities, the way all these heads look alike makes them pretty easy to identify as Olmec.

### Translation (General Meaning)

教授：那么，我们已经确认古代美索美洲文化在数千年间共享独特的艺术、建筑和技术。今天我们要讨论的是另一个早期美索美洲文化——奥尔梅克文明的艺术。

现在，分析任何艺术作品时，了解创作这些作品的人很有帮助。问题是，我们对创作奥尔梅克文明的人了解得并不多。我们对他们的了解，实际上主要是通过他们的艺术。

为什么我们了解这么少呢？奥尔梅克文明大约开始于公元前1200年，持续了仅仅700年，到公元前400年，奥尔梅克社会就消失了。

我们知道这些人生活在墨西哥南部沼泽的低洼地区，过着小规模的农业生活。他们捕鱼、养火鸡，并拥有广泛的贸易网络，交换如玉石等贵重材料。他们也有文字系统，我们将在研究他们的艺术时看到这些文字。但他们最著名的，还是他们的艺术。

奥尔梅克创造了巨大的石雕、彩绘壁画、精美的陶器，以及用玉石雕刻的小人物。但他们的巨大石雕头是最著名的艺术作品。这里有一张照片。这些头部雕像非常巨大，约三米高，比我们大多数人都要高一米，而且几乎一样宽。

它们都有相似的特点。这些头部非常圆，鼻子很宽，嘴唇非常厚，往下弯，看起来像是在皱眉。这些特点非常独特，一看到这些头部就能确认它们是奥尔梅克的。

而且有一个非常令人吃惊的事实，这些头部是用非常坚硬的石料雕刻的，而且仅使用石工具。奥尔梅克人没有金属工具，然而他们仅凭这些石工具，创造出了被许多人认为是古代美索美洲最精美的雕塑。真令人惊讶，他们用如此简单的工具创造出了如此出色的作品。

学生：那头上的那个帽子是什么？看起来像某种盔甲或什么东西。难道他们穿盔甲打仗吗？

教授：是的，它是一个盔甲，类似这样的盔甲可能确实提供了战斗保护，但大多数考古学家和艺术史学家认为它也用于奥尔梅克文化的球赛。在那些比赛中，队伍用橡胶球在专门为这些比赛建造的场地上进行比赛，这也引出了一个有趣的观点。

假设你在丛林中发现了一件古代雕塑，雕塑头部雕刻有一个盔甲。但你并不了解它来自的文化。那么你很可能会认为它是用来保护战士的。但如果你知道该地区其他古代民族也有类似的球赛，并且他们在比赛中穿着大量保护装备，你就会意识到它可能有另一层含义。它可能不是一个战士，而是一个球员的雕像。

所以你看，作为艺术史学家，你还必须了解人类学、考古学等学科，这样才能理解不同文化之间是如何相互影响的。你必须理解一个文化，它的地域，邻近的文化，才能真正理解它的艺术风格是如何发展的，符号意味着什么，从而对艺术做出有效的解释。换句话说，你不能单纯研究艺术，因为你需要有东西来对比艺术中的符号。那么，接下来我们来谈谈美洲豹。

美洲豹是奥尔梅克艺术中常见的图像。这种大型掠食性猫科动物在美洲广泛分布。它在奥尔梅克文化和宗教中非常重要。所以它在他们的艺术作品中频繁出现也就不足为奇了。它常常用来象征，实际上是美化一些重要人物，比如统治者。你甚至能在石雕头像中看到它的身影，像我们刚才看到的那个石雕头像。你看嘴巴，嘴唇往下弯，和大猫美洲豹的嘴巴很像，不是吗？

这也是为什么许多研究者认为这些头像代表了那个时期的重要统治者之一的原因。那，珍妮。

学生：对不起，教授，我现在有些困惑了。那些头像，难道是球员还是统治者？

教授：或者是战士？统治者通常扮演多个角色，有些是真实的，有些是仪式性的。所以这些雕像可能象征着多重含义。但无论如何，头像之间的相似性，让它们很容易被认定为奥尔梅克的作品。
